# DrinkCheckApp - React Native CLI Migration

This app has been successfully converted from Expo managed workflow to React Native CLI for physical device testing.

## What was changed:

### 1. Project Structure
- ✅ Added native `android/` and `ios/` directories
- ✅ Created `index.js` entry point for React Native CLI
- ✅ Added `App.tsx` with React Navigation setup
- ✅ Updated `package.json` with React Native CLI dependencies

### 2. Navigation
- ✅ Converted from Expo Router to React Navigation
- ✅ Maintained tab navigation structure (Monitor and History)
- ✅ Updated component imports and paths

### 3. Dependencies Replaced
- ✅ `expo-notifications` → `react-native-push-notification`
- ✅ `expo-status-bar` → React Native `StatusBar`
- ✅ Removed all Expo-specific dependencies
- ✅ Added React Navigation and required dependencies

### 4. Configuration Files
- ✅ `metro.config.js` - Metro bundler configuration
- ✅ `babel.config.js` - Babel preset for React Native
- ✅ Updated `app.json` for React Native CLI
- ✅ Updated `tsconfig.json` to use React Native preset

## Building for Physical Devices

### Android
1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Android Studio with SDK installed
   - USB debugging enabled on device
   - Device connected via USB

2. **Build Commands:**
   ```bash
   # Debug build
   npx react-native run-android
   
   # Release build (after setting up signing)
   npx react-native run-android --variant=release
   ```

3. **APK Generation:**
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   # APK will be in android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/
   ```

### iOS
1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Xcode installed
   - iOS device registered in Apple Developer account
   - Provisioning profile configured

2. **Build Commands:**
   ```bash
   # Install pods first
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   
   # Run on device
   npx react-native run-ios --device
   ```

### Push Notifications Setup
The app now uses `react-native-push-notification`. For production:

1. **Android:** Configure Firebase Cloud Messaging
2. **iOS:** Set up Apple Push Notification service

### Testing the Conversion
1. Start Metro bundler: `npx react-native start`
2. The bundler should start without errors
3. All screens should render correctly
4. Navigation between Monitor and History tabs should work
5. Notification permissions should be requested properly

## Original Functionality Preserved
- ✅ ESP32 device monitoring
- ✅ Temperature and humidity sensors
- ✅ Movement alerts
- ✅ Data history storage
- ✅ Neumorphic UI design
- ✅ Local data persistence with AsyncStorage

The app is now ready for physical device testing with React Native CLI!
